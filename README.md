# Sudoku

Sudoku is a puzzle in which players insert the numbers one to nine into a grid consisting of nine squares subdivided into a further nine smaller squares in such a way that every number appears once in each horizontal line, vertical line, and square.

I have always enjoyed playing Sudoku and wanted to see if I could build an app to automatically solve the puzzles.

## Overview

I am developing this app using .Net Core and WPF. This the first individual project I have done with either of those technologies. The main goal of the project is to reinforce my C# as well as to learn WFP and MVVM.
